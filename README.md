# A Pacman Clone solo project

**Note: The game is definitely rough around the edges but I might not fix everything I can since I need to move on to other projects.**

## Features

- Many subtle details from the original replicated (some partially due to some limitations)
- 1 fully playable level (could add more with more work)
- A full game loop
- Many UI elements including a pause menu
- Translations for several languages
- Controller support
- Supported platforms: Web Browser, Windows, MacOSX, Linux
